# Phaser Boilerplate

Fork or download this project to get a quick start on a new [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) project using ES2015+Babel in Node with Express for local testing. After it's unpacked, navigate to the folder and use `yarn` or `npm install` to install all the required packages and get ready.

This setup makes use of Phaser states to allow better image loading and ES2015 classes to provide a model for segmenting your code into more easily-readable pieces.
